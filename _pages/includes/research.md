# Research

My research interests center around the co-evolution of (proto) planets and their natal disks (protostellar disks, protoplanetary disks, and debris disks) from both theoretical and observational perspectives. Recently, my work has focused on investigating the formation of planetary systems from the pebble rings observed in ALMA. Additionally, I am interested in how the accreting planet interacts with the disk and shapes both disk chemistry and planet atmosphere composition. To answer these questions, I use numerical and analytical calculations of planet formation and disk evolution, to reproduce and predict real observations obtained via large ground-based observational facilities, such as [ALMA](http://almaobservatory.org/en/home/), [Subaru](https://www.naoj.org/jp/), and [VLT](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/). Meanwhile, I write proposals to conduct my own observations.
