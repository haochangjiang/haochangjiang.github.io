## Hi there! 

I am a PSF postdoctoral fellow at Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA) hosted by [Myriam Benisty](https://sites.google.com/view/mbenisty/home?authuser=0) since July 2024. Before Heidelberg, I was a graduate student at Tsinghua University, advised by [Chris Ormel](http://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~cormel/NewSite/) from 2019 to 2024. During this, I also spent 1.5 years at the ESO Garching headquarters with an [ESO Studentship](http://www.eso.org/sci/activities/fellowships-and-studentships/FeSt-overview/ESOstudentship.html), under the supervision of [Enrique Mac√≠as](https://sites.google.com/view/emacias/home).

I was born in a mining community in [Yunnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan) province, in the southwestern part of China, where I spent my joyful childhood til the age of 8. Due to the decline of the mining industry and the pursuit of better education opportunities for me, my parents moved away from the small mining town back to their hometown, Qujing, and 7 years later, we made our way to the capital of Yunnan province, Kunming. After I finished my elementary education in Kunming, I moved to USTC in Hefei for my bachelor's degree before entering Tsinghua.
