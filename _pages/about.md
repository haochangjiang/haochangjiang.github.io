## Hi there! 

I am a graduate student at Tsinghua University, where I have been advised by [Chris Ormel](http://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~cormel/NewSite/) since 2019. I am currently based at the ESO Garching headquarters, under the supervision of [Enrique Macías](https://sites.google.com/view/emacias/home), thanks to an ESO reach studentship.

I was born in a mining community in Yunnan province, in the southwestern part of China, where I spent my joyful childhood til the age of 8. Due to the decline of the mining industry and the pursuit of better education opportunities for me, my parents first moved away from the small mining town back to their hometown, Qujing, and 7 years after, made our way to the capital of Yunnan province, Kunming. After I finished my elementary education in Kunming, I moved to USTC in Hefei for my bachelor's degree before entering Tsinghua. In my spare time, I enjoy movies, music, and swimming.

# Research

My research interests center around the co-evolution of (proto) planets and their natal disks (protostellar disks, protoplanetary disks, and debris disks) from both theoretical and observational perspectives. Recently, my work has focused on investigating the formation of planetary systems from the pebble rings observed in ALMA. Additionally, I am interested in how the accreting planet interacts with the disk and shapes both disk chemistry and planet atmosphere composition. To answer these questions, I use numerical and theoretical calculations of planet formation and disk evolution, to reproduce and predict real observations conducted in large ground-based observational facilities such as [ALMA](http://almaobservatory.org/en/home/), [Subaru](https://www.naoj.org/jp/), and [VLT](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/). Meanwhile, I write proposals to conduct my own observations as well. For up-to-date list of my publication, check [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/p_=0&q=orcid%3A0000-0003-2948-5614&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc) or [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Jiang%2C+Haochang&searchtype=all)
